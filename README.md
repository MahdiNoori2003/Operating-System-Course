## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

### Projects

1. Socket Programming: This project establishes a robust communication network between three distinct user types: customers, restaurants, and suppliers. Using TCP and UDP ports, these users can seamlessly interact and exchange information.

    `User Types:`

    * `Customers:` Connect to restaurants to place orders, view menus, and etc.
    * `Restaurants:` Accept orders from customers, manage inventory, and communicate with suppliers.
    * `Suppliers:` Provide restaurants with ingredients and supplies, track inventory levels, and receive orders.

    `Communication Protocols:`

    The system utilizes both TCP and UDP protocols to ensure reliable and efficient communication.

    * `TCP:` Used for critical data transfers, such as order placement.
    * `UDP:` Used for real-time updates, such as opening notification.

    `Features:`

    * Seamless communication between customers, restaurants, and suppliers
    * Real-time updates and inventory management

2. Map Reduce: This project utilizes the MapReduce programming model to analyze the utility usage of different buildings. It processes large datasets containing electricity, gas, and water consumption data to calculate various metrics.

    `Map Phase:`
    * Parses input records and extracts relevant data (e.g., building ID, utility type, consumption value)

    `Reduce Phase:`
    * Aggregates consumption values for each building and utility type
    * Calculates metrics such as total consumption, average consumption, peak consumption, and bill

3. Multi Threading: This multithreading application leverages multiple threads to concurrently apply a series of filters to an input image. It optimizes image processing performance by distributing the workload across available CPU cores.


    `Multithreading Process:`

    `Thread Creation:`
    * The application creates multiple threads, each responsible for applying a specific filter to the input image.

    `Concurrent Processing:`
    * Threads run concurrently, processing different parts of the image simultaneously.

    `Image Combination:`
    * Once all filters have been applied, the final processed image is generated by combining the results from each thread.
